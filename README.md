================

I took LibCal's (sort of ugly, but effective) tables and made them look the way I want. Here's a photo of the digital display, looking the way I want it to look, only with test data:

Here's what the original LibCal tables look like, with some real data -- as you can see, they are very tall and very not-transparent:

And here's a screenshot of what this CSS did to those tables (the screenshot was taken before I added the code for the ellipses, but it's a good representation and has the benefit of including the same data as the second image, above):
